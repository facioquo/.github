# Contributing guidelines

**Thanks for taking the time to contribute!**

## Getting started

- Read this first: [A Step by Step Guide to Making Your First GitHub Contribution](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940).

## Submitting changes

By submitting changes to this repo you are also acknowledging and agree to the terms in both the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) 1.1](https://developercertificate.org), the LICENSE file in the code repository, and [GitHub site policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy).  License types vary across FacioQuo repositories; and when there is no LICENSE file, it means the code repository is private, proprietary, and not open-source.  These are standard open-source terms and conditions.

Do not commingle multiple contributions on different topics.  Please keep changes small and separate.

When ready, submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/pull-requests) with a clear list of what you've done.
Always write a clear log message for incremental commits and in the Pull Request descriptions. One-line messages are fine for most incremental commits.

After a Pull Request is reviewed, accepted, and _squash merged_ to `main`, we may batch changes before releasing a new official version.  Please be patient with turnaround time.

## Code reviews and administration

If you want to contribute administratively, do code reviews, or provide general user support, we're also currently seeking a few core people to help.  Please contact us if interested.
